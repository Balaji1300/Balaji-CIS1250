A software that I've used personally that I think has been designed well is Windows 10. I think it’s a well designed software because it has a good control panel to make things easy to understand and easy to get to where you want to be. I like how it takes the older version styles of the windows menu but still makes it look modern and fresh while making generally easy to access settings and apps. Windows 10 also has cool tools, like the ability to put windows next to each other so it’s easier to switch between different tabs. Overall it’s a great software used by millions of people everyday from  desktops, laptops or even capable tablets.
Software design is so important because it affects how the user works with the application. A software should have a friendly design and should show you how to use it without any complications. It’s also important because the design can make using the software more efficient, therefore having a better experience. To conclude I believe software design is very important because in short, it’s what makes the software functional and effective to use.
In software development, the stakeholders align and work together in the requirements gathering stage to define the product capabilities and requirements of the software production. In this phase, information concerning the detailed features, functionality and constraints of the software is gathered from end users, clients and business objectives. By doing this it will help the development team understand what the user expects from that final product. They can capture requirements through interviews, surveys, workshops, or document analysis. It is critical because this stage lays the base for the whole software development process. Developing software without the specification of clear requirements, for example, can result in a software that is not meeting the users needs and will cost to update, delay the project, and even make a project fail. Requirements that are properly assembled help direct the process and build a product that will accomplish what was intended and resolve the appropriate issues.
