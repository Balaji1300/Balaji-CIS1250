A software that I've used personally that I think has been designed well is Windows 10. I think it’s a well designed software because it has a good control panel to make things easy to understand and easy to get to where you want to be. I like how it takes the older version styles of the windows menu but still makes it look modern and fresh while making generally easy to access settings and apps. Windows 10 also has cool tools, like the ability to put windows next to each other so it’s easier to switch between different tabs. Overall it’s a great software used by millions of people everyday from  desktops, laptops or even capable tablets.
Software design is so important because it affects how the user works with the application. A software should have a friendly design and should show you how to use it without any complications. It’s also important because the design can make using the software more efficient, therefore having a better experience. To conclude I believe software design is very important because in short, it’s what makes the software functional and effective to use.
In software development, the stakeholders align and work together in the requirements gathering stage to define the product capabilities and requirements of the software production. In this phase, information concerning the detailed features, functionality and constraints of the software is gathered from end users, clients and business objectives. By doing this it will help the development team understand what the user expects from that final product. They can capture requirements through interviews, surveys, workshops, or document analysis. It is critical because this stage lays the base for the whole software development process. Developing software without the specification of clear requirements, for example, can result in a software that is not meeting the users needs and will cost to update, delay the project, and even make a project fail. Requirements that are properly assembled help direct the process and build a product that will accomplish what was intended and resolve the appropriate issues.

As a student, I want a friendly file explorer , so I can easily sort and access files.

As a worker, I want to be able to have multiple windows and desktops out at the same time, so I can increase my productivity.

As a gamer, I want to access a performance boosting game mode, so that I can run games with enhanced performance without my device overheating. 

As a developer, I want easy access to development tools, so that I can code, test and run tools more efficiently. 

As a home user, I want to have a dummy mode in the software, so that it is easier and less complicated for the older people in my family to use and understand. 


The Windows 10 operating system is taken by many to be a usable system developed by software giant Microsoft which is compatible with a great deal of devices and applications, and easily navigable with a user friendly interface. One of the biggest strengths of Windows 10 is that it can serve as a tool for countless users ranging from your humble home user to the very exacting professional or creative. The system boasts fluid multitasking through virtual desktops, custom start menus and a taskbar that automatically brings forward the most frequently used applications. It also excels in bringing a smooth user experience by integrating both legacy and modern apps which keep older software working while enabling the latest tech.

Windows 10’s updates keep occurring, as Windows Defender and automatic updates take care of a safe and optimized environment for users; security concerns are addressed proactively. The operating system includes a powerful, resource intensive applications support for creative professionals such as graphic designers and video editors; while keeping the system performance intact. Its flexibility runs into personalizing options where the user can customize its desktop layout, themes, and setting according to the user workflow.

In addition to the built in productivity tools like Cortana its virtual assistant, Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Office apps which aim to make handling more efficient. Overall, Windows 10 is a solid platform with integrity, good broad software compatibility, and the capacity to be tailored to the user with varying tech experience.

In software design, clarity of communication is a must in aligning team goals, rephrasing requirements, and progression of a project to definite result. Communication is very good to bridge a gap between developers, designers and stakeholders and make them all work synchronically on a common vision. Clarity, active listening and feedback are key components of good communication in software design. With clarity, there is no confusion of what the requirements and what our expectations as a team are. Active listening allows developers to really understand the technical part as well as the need from the user, which promotes empathy and helps prevent mistakes made. Iterative improvement is encouraged by feedback, which enables early catching (in design) of potential problems and the refinement of solutions.
In a project I recently worked on, I encountered a communication gap in which I misinterpreted requirements. On our end, we couldn’t define some feature specifications with the client early enough, which turned into several iterations and delays. If only I had better communications practices, then this would have been avoided. In particular, we would have regularly scheduled check in and received explicit feedback regarding each project milestone to check that we were understanding and spotting a discrepancy early. Now, I would also bring out the point of asking open ended questions to not only check for alignment thinking in the process, but further provide specific feedback. We could have saved some huge amount in rework and kept the development path smooth if we had used this approach.
